Technologies Used
gameStopClone was built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The backend core server and database were created using sequelize and express, respectively. While the HTML (through the use of react) used to structure the app, and CSS was used to style it.

When entering the website, users are able to use the Search Bar or Shop Sidebar to search for products that they maybe interested in purchasing. Once the user registers/logs-in, they are able to make purchases themselves as well as write reviews for particular products of their choice.
